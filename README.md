# hello-world
first repository. testing to get the hang of GitHub. not to be shared with anyone

these are the first changes to the hello-world file. i am adding this to test the idea of branches and to learn and get the hang of them. this should be under the branch called "readme-edits". that should be a branch off of the master branch for the hello-world repository
